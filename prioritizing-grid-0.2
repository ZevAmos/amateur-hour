this is because the number of sequential pairs in a list of consecutive integers is going to be 1 less than the number of integers in that list. 
So numbers 1-10 has 10 integers, and 9 pairs. The variable "pairs" is defined later because it updates per iteration. 
'''

'''
"a" and "b" are coordinate values representing the index of items to be compared. "c" is a variable that moves "b"
over one index per set iteration to achieve a "diagonal" series of comparisons.

    resets coordinates. "a" is always the first item. "b" is always the item one index higher than the previous set's "b"

        subtracts pts from the chosen item, so it will move to a lower index when sorted.
        in event of a "circular preference" each item is preferable to each other item
        so values are identical and the order remains the same.

'''the program doesn't use any sort of memory to hold pair comparisons, so rather than refer to the original contest between tied items it just asks for them to be 
compared again. Uses a number iterated through a range equivalent to the items list's indicies to compare one item and the next. If they have tied scores the user 
is prompted to rank them. Since the order would remain the same if the preceeding item were chosen (always "a") the flow program only looks for "b" results, and then swaps 
their locations in the items list. I will add something to intercept typos later'''
